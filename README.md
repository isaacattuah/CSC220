# 🎓 CSC220: Data Structures & Algorithms

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This repository contains historical implementations from a Spring 2018 course offering. Course requirements, project specifications, and evaluation criteria may have changed significantly since then. This content is meant for learning purposes only - **do not copy or submit as your own work**. Always refer to your current course syllabus and instructor's requirements.

Welcome to CSC220! This repository contains implementations and explanations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, culminating in building a mini search engine. Each project builds upon previous concepts, taking you from basic array operations to implementing a functional search engine.

## � Course History
This repository contains algorithms and exercises from CSC220 Spring 2018 class taught by Dr. Victor Milenkovic at the University of Miami. The projects are based on his original course materials and have been implemented as learning resources.
